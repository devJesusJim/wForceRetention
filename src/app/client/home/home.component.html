                Most managers believe employees leave because of 'pull' factors such as better pay or career
                opportunities, rather than 'push' factors that occur long before employees look for greener pastures.
                Many exit programs don't focus on what happened when the employee first set their mind on leaving.
                Workforce Retention specialises in getting meaningful information through the exit process, and reports
                this back to business leaders so action can be taken.

                Find the top reasons for leaving quickly and efficiently via our simple chart-based reporting
                platform.
                Our exit interviews are structured in such a way that reasons for leaving are pushed to the top and
                ranked in order of what has the greatest propensity for employees to leave.
